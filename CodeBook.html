<h1>Code Book </h1>

<p>This is an R Markdown document that explains the creation of the tidy data set for the Course Project for Getting and Cleaning Data.  </p>

<h2>The data source</h2>

<p>Original data: <a href="https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip">https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip</a> </p>

<p>Original description of the dataset: <a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones">http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones</a> </p>

<h2>Original Data</h2>

<h3>From Readme.txt in original data set.</h3>

<p>Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset
Version 1.0</p>

<p>Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz, Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto.
Smartlab - Non Linear Complex Systems Laboratory
DITEN - Universit√† degli Studi di Genova.
Via Opera Pia 11A, I-16145, Genoa, Italy.

<p>The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. </p>

<p>The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See &#39;features_info.txt&#39; for more details. </p>

<h4>For each record it is provided:</h4>

<ul>
<li>Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.</li>
<li>Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. </li>
<li>A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. </li>
<li>Its activity label. </li>
<li>An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.</li>
</ul>

<h4>The dataset includes the following files:</h4>

<ul>
<li><p>&#39;README.txt&#39;</p></li>
<li><p>&#39;features_info.txt&#39;: Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.</p></li>
<li><p>&#39;features.txt&#39;: List of all features.</p></li>
<li><p>&#39;activity_labels.txt&#39;: Links the class labels with their activity name.</p></li>
<li><p>&#39;train/X_train.txt&#39;: Training set.</p></li>
<li><p>&#39;train/y_train.txt&#39;: Training labels.</p></li>
<li><p>&#39;test/X_test.txt&#39;: Test set.</p></li>
<li><p>&#39;test/y_test.txt&#39;: Test labels.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>&#39;train/subject_train.txt&#39;: Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. </p></li>
<li><p>&#39;train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt&#39;: The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units &#39;g&#39;. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the &#39;total_acc_x_train.txt&#39; and &#39;total_acc_z_train.txt&#39; files for the Y and Z axis. </p></li>
<li><p>&#39;train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt&#39;: The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration. </p></li>
<li><p>&#39;train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt&#39;: The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second. </p></li>
</ul>

<h4>Notes: </h4>

<ul>
<li>Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].</li>
<li>Each feature vector is a row on the text file.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Transformation of the Data </h2>

<h3>Need the following packages in R in addition to base packages</h3>

<ol>
<li>read.table </li>
<li> reshape2</li>
<li> Install both packages and use library function to make each usable</li>
</ol>

<h3>Explanation of Transformation</h3>

<p>R script for the transformation is included in the script run_analysis.R that does the following per the project assignment: </p>

<ol>
<li>Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.</li>
<li>Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. </li>
<li>Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set</li>
<li>Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. </li>
<li>Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. This data set is called tidy_data.txt.</li>
</ol>

<p>See readme.md file that is included for explanation on how each step is executed within the run_analysis.R script.</p>
